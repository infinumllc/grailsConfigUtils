In your Grails project, add this project as a dependency in your BuildConfig.groovy.  

One of the feature provided is a detection of external configs.  To use it, put the ConfigUtils.verifyExternalConfigs static method in your Config.groovy to print a message to stdout regarding whether your external configuration file was found.

Just call in grails-app/conf/Config.groovy after 
grails.config.locations = [...]
ConfigUtils.verifyExternalConfigs(grails.config.locations)

Be sure to set the Import for ConfigUtils in your Config.groovy
